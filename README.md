# Weldj
Java Bindings for [Weld](https://github.com/weld-project/weld)

## How to Generate Weldj?
The bindings were generated using [Swig](http://www.swig.org/). The `C` header files published by the weld-project [here](https://github.com/weld-project/weld/tree/master/weld-capi) as of release [0.4.0](https://github.com/weld-project/weld/releases/tag/v0.4.0) were fed into Swig. The steps to regenerate `Weldj` are documented in [How to Generate Weldj](GENERATE.md).
